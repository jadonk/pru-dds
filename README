This project is a Direct Digital Synthesizer signal generator for 
the Beaglebone Black PRU (it may also work on other boards such as
the Beaglebone White, but I haven't tested this).  You can load its 
wavetable with various waveshapes, and you can have it run at all
sorts of different frequencies with surprising resolution (at 3KHz,
it has about 1/100 Hz resolution).  Hooked to an op-amp it could be
used as a pretty good low-frequency signal generator for testing
things, or perhaps be the LO for something?

Be aware, PRU fast GPIO is incompatible with the HDMI, so firstly
you can't use them together, and secondly, you'll have to disable
the HDMI by doing the following (this is, of course, totally
reversable!):

# mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/card
You should find the file "/mnt/card/uEnv.txt", which should have a
single line of text in it, to which you should append the following:
 capemgr.disable_partno=BB-BONELT-HDMI,BB-BONELT-HDMIN
So for example if the file contains 
 optargs=quiet
You should change it to contain
 optargs=quiet capemgr.disable_partno=BB-BONELT-HDMI,BB-BONELT-HDMIN
Having done this, save the file and reboot.

Also, if you are having trouble cloning this project from git, look 
into the following URL:
http://derekmolloy.ie/fixing-git-and-curl-certificates-problem-on-beaglebone-blac/
and while you're at it, fix your clock:

Look for output from P9 31,29,30,28,42,27,41,25 (LSB to MSB) ready to
feed into an R-2R or other DAC.  IF you modify config.pl to use PRU1
instead of PRU0, look for output on P8 45,46,43,44,41,42,39,40. 
Running on PRU1 has only been tested so far as compiling the dtbo and
successfully installing it, so it may not work at all.  Be aware that
since in my experience uninstalling a dtbo requires a reboot anyway,
I make all variants of my dtbo have the same name (which is probably 
very very bad practice.  I'll deal with that if someone finds a
legitimate reason to complain about it.
